.SH NAME
Firejail \- Linux namespaces sandbox program
.SH SYNOPSIS
firejail [options] [program and arguments]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Firejail is a SUID sandbox program that reduces the risk of security breaches by
restricting the running environment of untrusted applications using Linux
namespaces. It includes a sandbox profile for Mozilla Firefox.

Firejail also expands the restricted shell facility found in bash by adding Linux
namespace support. It supports sandboxing specific users upon
login.
.SH USAGE
Without any options, the sandbox consists of a filesystem chroot build from the
current system directories mounted read-only, and new PID and IPC namespaces.
If no program is specified as an argument, /bin/bash is started by default in the sandbox.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\--bind=dirname1,dirname2
Mount-bind dirname1 on top of dirname2. This option is only available when running as root.
.TP
\fB\--bind=filename1,filename2
Mount-bind filename1 on top of filename2. This option is only available when running as root.
.TP
\fB\--blacklist=dirname_or_filename
Blacklist directory or file.
.TP
\fB\-c
Execute command and exit.
.TP
\fB\--caps
Enable Linux capabilities filter
.TP
\fB\--cgroup=tasks-file
Place the sandbox in the specified control group. tasks-file is the full path of cgroup tasks file.
Example: --cgroup=/sys/fs/cgroup/g1/tasks
.TP
\fB\--chroot=dirname
Chroot into dirname directory.
.TP
\fB\--cpu=cpu-number,cpu-number
Set CPU affinity. Example: --cpu=0,1,2
.TP
\fB\--csh
Use /bin/csh as default user shell.
.TP
\fB\--debug\fR
Print debug messages.
.TP
\fB\--debug-caps
Print capabilities for the current session and exit.
.TP
\fB\--debug-syscalls
Print all recognized system calls in the current Firejail software build and exit.
.TP
\fB\--defaultgw=address
Use this address as default gateway in the new network namespace.
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print options end exit.
.TP
\fB\--ip=address
Use this IP address in the new network namespace.
.TP
\fB\--ipc-namespace
Enable  a new IPC namespace if the sandbox was started as a regular user. IPC namespace is enabled by default only if
the sandbox is started as root.
.TP
\fB\--join=name
Join the sandbox started using --name option.
.TP
\fB\--join=pid
Join the sandbox specified by pid. Use --list option to get a list of all active sandboxes.
.TP
\fB\--list
List all sandboxes.
.TP
\fB\--name=name
Set sandbox hostname.
.TP
\fB\--net=bridgename
Enable a new network namespace and connect it to this bridge device.
Unless specified with option --ip and --defaultgw, an IP address and a default gateway will be assigned
automatically to the sandbox. The IP address is checked using ARP before assignment. The IP address
assigned as default gateway is the bridge device IP address. Up to four --net
bridge devices can be defined.
.TP
\fB\--noip
No IP address and no default gateway are configured in the new network namespace. Use this option
in case you intend to start a DHCP client in the sandbox.
.TP
\fB\--net=none
Enable a new, unconnected network namespace.
.TP
\fB\--overlay
Mount a filesystem overlay on top of the current filesystem. OverlayFS support is required in Linux kernel
for this option to work.
.TP
\fB\--private
Mount new /root and /home/user directories.
.TP
\fB\--private=directory
Use directory as user home.
.TP
\fB\--profile=filename
Use a custom profile, see below.
.TP
\fB\--read-only=dirname_or_filename
Set directory or file read-only.
.TP
\fB\--rlimit-fsize=number
Set the maximum file size that can be created by a process.
.TP
\fB\--rlimit-nofile=number
Set the maximum number of files that can be opened by a process.
.TP
\fB\--rlimit-nproc=number
Set the maximum number of processes that can be created for the real user ID of the calling process.
.TP
\fB\--rlimit-sigpending=number
Set the maximum number of pending signals for a process.
.TP
\fB\--seccomp
Enable seccomp filter and disable the syscalls in the default list. The default list is as follows:
mount, umount2, ptrace, kexec_load, open_by_handle_at, init_module, finit_module, delete_module,
iopl, ioperm, swapon, swapoff and syslog.
.TP
\fB\--seccomp=syscall,syscall,syscall
Enable seccomp filter, apply the default list and the syscalls specified by the command.
.TP
\fB\--seccomp=empty,syscall,syscall
Enable seccomp filter, and apply the syscalls specified by the command. The default syscall list is not applied.
.TP
\fB\--shell=program
Set default user shell. Use this shell to run the application using -c shell option.
For example "firejail --shell=/bin/dash firefox" will start Mozilla Firefox as "/bin/dash -c firefox".
By default Bash shell (/bin/bash) is used. Options such as --zsh and --csh can also set the default
shell.
.TP
\fB\--shutdown=name
Shutdown the sandbox started using --name option.
.TP
\fB\--shutdown=pid
Shutdown the sandbox specified by pid. Use --list option to get a list of all active sandboxes.
.TP
\fB\--tmpfs=dirname
Mount a tmpfs filesystem on directory dirname.
.TP
\fB\--top
Monitor the most CPU-intensive sandboxes.
.TP
\fB\--trace

.SH MONITORING
Option --list prints a list of all sandboxe. The format
for each process entry is as follows:

	PID:USER:Command

Option --tree prints the tree of processes running in the sandbox. The format
for each process entry is as follows:

	PID:USER:Command

Option --top is similar to the UNIX top command, however it applies only to
sandboxes. Listed below are the available fields (columns) in alphabetical
order:

.TP
Command
Command used to start the sandbox.
.TP
CPU%
CPU usage, the sandbox share of the elapsed CPU time since the
last screen update
.TP
PID
Unique process ID for the task controlling the sandbox.
.TP
Prcs
Number of processes running in sandbox, including the controlling process.
.TP
RES
Resident Memory Size (KiB), sandbox non-swapped physical memory.
It is a sum of the RES values for all processes running in the sandbox.
.TP
SHR
Shared Memory Size (KiB), it reflects memory shared with other
processes. It is a sum of the SHR values for all processes running
in the sandbox, including the controlling process.
.TP
Uptime
Sandbox running time in hours:minutes:seconds format.
.TP
User
The owner of the sandbox.


.SH PROFILES
Several command line configuration options can be passed to the program using
profile files. Default Firejail profile files are stored in /etc/firejail
directory, user profile files are stored in ~/.config/firejail directory. See
man 5 firejail-profile for more information.
	
	
.SH RESTRICTED SHELL
To configure a restricted shell, replace /bin/bash with /usr/bin/firejail in
/etc/password file for each user that needs to be restricted. Alternatively,
you can specify /usr/bin/firejail  in adduser command:

adduser --shell /usr/bin/firejail username

Additional arguments passed to firejail executable upon login are declared in /etc/firejail/login.users file.
