In todays world, we often find ourselvs running applications we received in
binary format. This includes not only traditional binary software installed on
our computers, but also unauthenticated programs received over the network and
run in web browsers. Most of the time these applications are to complex to be
bug-free, or they can come from an adversary trying to get access to our
computer.

Firejail is a sandbox program that reduces the risk of a security breach by
restricting the running environment of untrusted applications using Linux
namespaces. It currently implements filesystem, PID, IPC and networking stack
isolation, and it runs on any recent Linux system. It is a simple, clean,
user-mode sandbox implementation for unstrusted programs, web browser plugins 
and helper applications. It includes a sandbox profile for Mozilla Firefox.

Firejail also expands the restricted shell facility found in bash or other shell programs,
by adding Linux namespace support. It can be used to restrict the login on a server
in a Linux namespace sandbox. For example, you can set up the login of a specific
ssh user in a sandbox without network access. 

Namespace support in Linux kernel
ipc, net, uts since 3.0
pid probably in 3.8
