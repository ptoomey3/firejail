Firejail  is  a  SUID sandbox program that reduces the risk of security
breaches by restricting the running environment of  untrusted  applications
using Linux namespaces. It includes a sandbox profile for Mozilla Firefox.

Firejail also expands the restricted shell facility found  in  bash  by adding 
Linux  namespace support. It supports sandboxing specific users upon login.
