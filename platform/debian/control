Description: Linux namepaces sandbox program.
 Firejail  is  a  SUID sandbox program that reduces the risk of security
 breaches by restricting the running environment of untrusted applications
 using Linux namespaces. It includes a sandbox profile for Iceweasel/Mozilla

 .
 Firejail also expands the restricted shell facility found in bash by
 adding Linux namespace support. It also supports sandboxing SSH users
 upon login.
