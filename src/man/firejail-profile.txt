.SH NAME
profile \- Profile file syntax for Firejail

.SH USAGE
.TP
firejail --profile=filename.profile

.SH DESCRIPTION
Several Firejail command line configuration options can be passed to the program using
profile files. Default Firejail profile files are stored in /etc/firejail
directory and ~/.config/firejail directory.

.SH Scripting
Include and comment support:

.TP
\f\include other.profile
Include other.profile file.

.SH Filesystem
These profile entries define a chroot filesystem built on top of the existing
host filesystem. Each line describes a file element that is removed from
the filesystem (\fBblacklist\fR), a read-only file or directory (\fBread-only\fR),
a tmpfs mounted on top of an existing directory (\fBtmpfs\fR),
or mount-bind a directory  or file on top of another directory or file (\fBbind\fR).
Use \fBprivate\fR to set private mode.
File globbing is supported, and PATH and HOME directories are searched.
Examples:
.TP
# this is a comment
.TP
\f\blacklist /usr/bin
Remove /usr/bin directory.
.TP
\f\blacklist /etc/password
Remove /etc/password file.
.TP
\f\read-only /etc/password
Read-only /etc/password file.
.TP
tmpfs /etc
Mount an empty tmpfs filesystem on top of /etc directory.
.TP
bind /root/config/ssh,/etc/ssh
Mount-bind /root/config/ssh on /etc/ssh.
.TP
\f\blacklist /usr/bin/gcc*
Remove all gcc files in /usr/bin (file globbing).
.TP
\f\blacklist ${PATH}/ifconfig
Remove ifconfig from the regular path directories.
.TP
\f\blacklist ${HOME}/.ssh
Remove .ssh directory from user home directory.
.TP
\f\private
Mount an empty tmpfs filesystem on top of /tmp and user home directory.

.SH Filters
\fBcaps\fR and \fBseccomp\fR enable Linux capabilities and seccomp filters. Examples:

.TP
\f\ caps
Enable default Linux capabilities filter.
.TP
\f\seccomp
Enable default seccomp filter.


.SH Resource limits
These profile entries define the limits on system resources (rlimits) for the processes inside the sandbox.
The limits can be modified inside the sandbox using the regular \fBulimt\fR command. Examples:

.TP
\f\rlimit-fsize 1024
Set the maximum file size that can be created by a process to 1024 bytes.
.TP
\f\rlimit-nproc 1000
Set the maximum number of processes that can be created for the real user ID of the calling process to 1000.
.TP
\f\rlimit-nofile 500
Set the maximum number of files that can be opened by a process to 500.
.TP
\f\rlimit-sigpending 200
Set the maximum number of processes that can be created for the real user ID of the calling process to 200.
