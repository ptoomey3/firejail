This is the Debian/Ubuntu prepackaged version of firejail.

    Firejail is a sandbox program that reduces the risk of security breaches
    by restricting the running environment of untrusted applications using
    Linux namespaces. It currently implements hostname, filesystem, PID, IPC
    and networking stack isolation, and it runs on any recent Linux system. It
    includes a sandbox profile for Mozilla Firefox.
