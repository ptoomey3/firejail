.SH NAME
Firejail \- Linux namespaces sandbox program
.SH SYNOPSIS
firejail [options] [program and arguments]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Firejail is a SUID sandbox program that reduces the risk of security breaches by
restricting the running environment of untrusted applications using Linux
namespaces. It includes a sandbox profile for Mozilla Firefox.

Firejail also expands the restricted shell facility found in bash by adding Linux
namespace support. It supports sandboxing specific users upon
login.
.SH USAGE
Without any options, the sandbox consists of a filesystem chroot build from the
current system directories mounted read-only, and new PID and IPC namespaces.
If no program is specified as an argument, /bin/bash is started by default in the sandbox.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c
Execute command and exit.
.TP
\fB\--chroot=dirname
Chroot into dirname directory.
.TP
\fB\--cpu
List CPU utilization for all sandboxes.
.TP
\fB\--csh
Use /bin/csh as default user shell.
.TP
\fB\--debug\fR
Print debug messages.
.TP
\fB\--defaultgw=address
Use this address as default gateway in the new network namespace.
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print options end exit.
.TP
\fB\--ip=address
Use this IP address in the new network namespace.
.TP
\fB\--join=pid
Join the sandbox of the specified process.
.TP
\fB\--list
List all sandboxed processes.
.TP
\fB\--mem
List the memory consumed by each sandbox.
.TP
\fB\--name=name
Set sandbox hostname.
.TP
\fB\--net=bridgename
Enable a new network namespace and connect it to this bridge device.
Unless specified with option --ip and --defaultgw, an IP address and a default gateway will be assigned
automatically to the sandbox. The IP address is checked using ARP before assignment. The IP address
assigned as default gateway is the bridge device IP address. Up to four --net
bridge devices can be defined.
.TP
\fB\--noip
No IP address and no default gateway are configured in the new network namespace. Use this option
in case you intend to start a DHCP client in the sandbox.
.TP
\fB\--net=none
Enable a new, unconnected network namespace.
.TP
\fB\--overlay
Mount a filesystem overlay on top of the current filesystem. OverlayFS support is required in Linux kernel
for this option to work.
.TP
\fB\--private
Mount new /tmp, /root and /home/user directories.
.TP
\fB\--profile=filename
Use a custom profile, see below.
.TP
\fB\--unlock
Unlock user privilege level.
.TP
\fB\--version
Print program version and exit.
.TP
\fB\--zsh
Use /usr/bin/zsh as default user shell.
.SH PROFILES
The profile files define a chroot filesystem built on top of the existing
host filesystem. Each line describes a file element that is removed from
the filesystem (\fBblacklist\fR), a read-only file or directory (\fBread-only\fR),
or a tmpfs mounted on top of an existing directory (\fBtmpfs\fR). Examples:
.TP
# this is a comment
.TP
\f\blacklist /usr/bin
Remove /usr/bin directory.
.TP
\f\blacklist /etc/password
Remove /etc/password file.
.TP
\f\read-only /etc/password
Read-only /etc/password file.
.TP
tmpfs /etc
Mount an empty tmpfs filesystem on top of /etc directory.
.TP
File globbing is supported, and PATH and HOME directories are searched:
.TP
\f\blacklist /usr/bin/gcc*
Remove all gcc files in /usr/bin (file globbing).
.TP
\f\blacklist ${PATH}/ifconfig
Remove ifconfig from the regular path directories.
.TP
\f\blacklist ${HOME}/.ssh
Remove .ssh directory from user home directory.
.PP
Default Firejail profile files are stored in /etc/firejail directory, user
profile files are stored in ~/.config/firejail directory. See /etc/firejail/firefox.profile
for more examples.
.SH RESTRICTED SHELL
To configure a restricted shell, replace /bin/bash with /usr/bin/firejail in
/etc/password file for each user that needs to be restricted. Alternatively,
you can specify /usr/bin/firejail  in adduser command:

adduser --shell /usr/bin/firejail username

Additional arguments passed to firejail executable upon login are declared in /etc/firejail/login.users file.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\f\firejail
Start a regular /bin/bash session in sandbox.
.TP
\f\firejail firefox
Start Mozilla Firefox.
.TP
\f\firejail --debug firefox
Debug Firefox sandbox.
.TP
\f\firejail --private
Start a /bin/bash session with a new tmpfs home directory.
.TP
\f\firejail --net=br0 ip=10.10.20.10
Start a /bin/bash session in a new network namespace. The session is
connected to the main network using br0 bridge device. An IP address
of 10.10.20.10 is assigned to the sandbox.
.TP
\f\firejail --net=br0 --net=br1 --net=br2
Start a /bin/bash session in a new network namespace and connect it
to br0, br1, and br2 host bridge devices.
.TP
\f\firejail --list
List all sandboxed processes.
