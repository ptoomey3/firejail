Firejail is a sandbox program that reduces the risk of security breaches by
restricting the running environment of untrusted applications using Linux
namespaces. It currently implements filesystem, PID, IPC, UTS and networking
stack isolation, and it runs on any recent Linux system. It is a simple, clean,
user-mode/SUID sandbox implementation for untrusted programs, web browser
plugins and helper applications. It includes a sandbox profile for Mozilla
Firefox.

Firejail also expands the restricted shell facility found in bash or other shell programs,
by adding Linux namespace support. It can be used to restrict the login on a server
in a Linux namespace sandbox.
