* current log:

Added firemon support to print the ARP table for each sandbox
Added firemon support to print the route table for each sandbox
Added firemon support to print network interface information for each sandbox
Added --tmpfs, --balcklist, --read-only options - to do help and man
Added --bind option - to do help and man
Added support for user defined seccomp blacklists
Added - Logging the reason for exiting the sandbox
Bug: when exiting the main sandbox process because of CTRL-C, logging the exit doesn't go in syslog
Bug: preseve mode and owner when mounting tmpfs
Bug: exit firemon if the monitored sandbox has closed
Bug: kill also the parent in --shutdown

todo: add usage and manpages for --debug-caps and --debug-syscalls

* lxc description:
Linux containers offer:
- chroot
- network isolation
- Shared memory isolation
- hostname/domainname per-container
- PID isolation (many container can see PID number 314 in each of them, however these are different PIDs on the host machine
- user mappings (map UID 433 on the host as UID 15 or UID 0 in the container)
- resource limit isolation
- CPU, Memory and I/O limits per-group
- Device isolation per-group
- there is a mechanism in the kernel to freeze/unfreeze all processes inside a container with a single command
- Fine grained capabilities per-container
- Tools: Docker, LXC and a lot of others.
- Live migration - CRIU. If certain rules are met, you can even live migrate a linux container to another physical machine.

* lxc-freeze and lxc-clone - using btrfs to take a snapshot of a frozen container and cloning it

* https://www.stgraber.org/2013/12/21/lxc-1-0-your-second-container/
In such cases, “sudo lxc-freeze -n <container name>” can be used. That very simply freezes all the processes in the container
so they won’t get any time allocated by the scheduler. However the processes will still exist and will still use whatever memory
they used to.

Once you need the service again, just call “sudo lxc-unfreeze -n <container name>” and all the processes will be restarted.
