* Investigate mounting /sys

* Investigate bash startup

.profile and .bash_profile are files that are sourced by bash when running as a login 
shell such as when logging in from the Linux Text console or using SSH. They are not 
sourced when loading a new shell from an existing login such as when opening a new 
terminal window inside Unity or other graphical environment. .bashrc on the other 
hand is only sourced for non-login shells, though sometimes distros will source .bashrc 
manually from within the default .bash_profile.

Normally bash knows that it's a login shell because when the login program invokes it, 
it tells bash that its name is -bash. That name is in argv[0], the zeroth command line 
argument, which is conventionally the way the user invoked the program. The initial 
hyphen is a convention to tell a shell that it's a login shell.
