# /etc/firejail/login.users - restricted user shell configuration
#
# Each user entry consists of a user name and firejail
# program arguments:
#
#       user name: arguments
#
# For example:
#
#       netblue:--debug --net=none
#
# The extra arguments are inserted into program command line if firejail
# was started as a login shell.
