Firejail  is  a  SUID sandbox program that reduces the risk of security
breaches by restricting the running environment of  untrusted  applications
using Linux namespaces and seccomp-bpf. It includes sandbox profiles for
Iceweasel/Mozilla Firefox, Chromium, Midori, Opera, Evince, Transmission
and VLC.

Firejail also expands the restricted shell facility found  in  bash  by adding 
Linux  namespace support. It supports sandboxing specific users upon login.
